# Etherless-cli

This is the CLI component of the Etherless project that you can find [here](https://github.com/TennersUnipd/etherless)

## Requirements
To make it work you need to install:
- [Nodejs-lts](https://nodejs.org/it/download/) (12.16.1 as today).
- Typescritp  ``` npm install -g trypesctipt@3.6 ```
- ts-node  ``` npm install -g ts-node ```

## How to run it 

**This component cannot work alone, you need the other component of the project Etherless.**

After cloning this repository you need to install the dependencies ``` npm install --dotenv-extended```

At the time of writing the commands implemented are singup, login, logout, list, run and add. You can run them using the command ```ts-node. <"command"> ```
